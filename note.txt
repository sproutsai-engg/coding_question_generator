1 Two sum -- some test cases are not correct (3 out of 8)
3  Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters -- few test cases are wrong

These are the Instructions:
                    1. write only the call(main) function from the {sample_code}.
                        "cpp": from sample code of cpp just write the call(main) function of it correctly, do not forget to write #include .
                        "java": from sample code of java just write the call(main) function of it, do not forget to write import.java .
                        "python":from sample code of python just write the code to run the functions from sample code of python
                        "javascript": from sample code of javascript just write the call(main) function of it.
